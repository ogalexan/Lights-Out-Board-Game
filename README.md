# Lights-Out-Board-Game
Lights Out game using C++ graphics 

The game begins with a 5x5 grid of lights, when you hover on a light the box will have a red circle indicating your pressence on the light. Clicking on lights triggers the box your mouse clicked and light to the left, right, above and below to flip their 'switch'. The gif below provides a visual guide to the appearance of the game. The user wins when all the lights have been turned off, there are certain winning patterns that allow will result in all lights turned off simulatenously. 

This project is coded in C++ using graphics libraries GLFW, GLAD, and GLM. This project was completed with the help of my partner, Noah Holbrook and starter code provided by my professor Lisa Dion in Advanced Programming at the University of Vermont.
